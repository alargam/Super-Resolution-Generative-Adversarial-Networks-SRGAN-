This repository contains the implementation of a **Swift SRGAN (Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network)** for image super-resolution. The goal of this project is to enhance the resolution and quality of low-resolution images using deep learning techniques. The model is trained to generate high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs, making it useful for applications such as medical imaging, satellite imagery, and more.

## Introduction

Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (SRGANs) are a class of deep learning models designed to enhance the resolution of images. This project implements a **Swift SRGAN** model, which is optimized for faster training and inference while maintaining high-quality results. The model is trained using a combination of adversarial loss, perceptual loss, and total variation loss to ensure that the generated images are both sharp and realistic.

### Key Features:
- **Swift SRGAN Architecture**: A lightweight and efficient GAN architecture for image super-resolution.
- **Custom Loss Functions**: Combines adversarial loss, perceptual loss, and total variation loss for better image quality.
- **Streamlit Web App**: An interactive web interface to test the model on sample images or your own images.
- **Pre-trained Models**: Includes pre-trained models for quick inference.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Swift-SRGAN.git
   cd Swift-SRGAN
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the dataset:

Place your dataset in the appropriate directory or use the script in make_dataset.py to download and extract it.

Train the model:

Run the training script:

bash
Copy
python train_model.py --upscale_factor 4 --num_epochs 100 --batch_size 32
Run the Streamlit app:

Start the Streamlit app to interact with the model:

bash
Copy
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
Usage
Training the Model
To train the SRGAN model, use the following command:

bash
Copy
python train_model.py --upscale_factor 4 --num_epochs 100 --batch_size 32
--upscale_factor: The factor by which the image resolution will be increased (default: 4).

--num_epochs: The number of epochs to train the model (default: 100).

--batch_size: The batch size for training (default: 32).

Using the Streamlit App
The Streamlit app provides an interactive interface to test the model. You can:

View examples of image enhancement.

Upload your own images to see the super-resolution results.

Explore technical details about the model.

To run the app:

bash
Copy
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
Results
Sample Outputs
Here are some examples of low-resolution images and their corresponding super-resolved versions generated by the Swift SRGAN model:

Low-Resolution Image	Super-Resolution Image
LR Image 1	SR Image 1
LR Image 2	SR Image 2
Evaluation Metrics
The model is evaluated using the following metrics:

PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio): Measures the quality of the generated images.

SSIM (Structural Similarity Index): Evaluates the structural similarity between the generated and ground truth images.
